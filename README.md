Welcome to my Password Generator! This site will generate letters, numbers , and special characters  from 8 to 128 characters.
when you go in and check the desired characters  that I inputted (uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters) you will be prompted to put in a number between 8 and 128 for desired length. When your desired length is in, then you hit ok and your random password will be generated.
